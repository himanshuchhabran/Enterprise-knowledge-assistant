Nebula9.ai Employee Handbook - 2025
Welcome to the team! This document outlines some of our key company policies and procedures.
1. Human Resources (HR) Policies
1.1 Dress Code
Our company maintains a business casual dress code. While we encourage you to be comfortable, please ensure your attire is professional and appropriate for a client-facing environment. On Fridays, smart casual wear (including clean jeans and sneakers) is permitted.
1.2 Performance Reviews
Performance reviews are conducted bi-annually, in June and December. Your manager will schedule a one-on-one meeting to discuss your achievements, goals, and areas for development. This is a two-way conversation, and your feedback is highly valued.
1.3 Working Hours & Flexibility
Our standard office hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Monday to Friday. We offer a flexible start time between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM. A one-hour lunch break is standard. All employees are expected to be available for core collaboration hours between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM.
2. Information Technology (IT) Policies
2.1 Password Security
All employee passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters and include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be changed every 90 days. Do not share your password with anyone. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is mandatory for all company systems.
2.2 Software Requests
All software must be approved and installed by the IT department to ensure security and license compliance. To request new software, please submit a ticket through the IT Helpdesk portal. Include the business justification for the request. Unauthorized software installation is strictly prohibited.
2.3 Acceptable Use of Equipment
Company-provided equipment (laptops, phones, etc.) is for business purposes. Limited personal use is acceptable, but it must not interfere with your work or violate any company policies. Do not install personal applications without prior approval from the IT department.
3. General Office Policies
3.1 Meeting Room Booking
Please book meeting rooms in advance using the shared Outlook calendar. If you no longer need a room, cancel your booking promptly to free it up for others. Please leave the room tidy after your meeting, erasing whiteboards and disposing of any trash.
3.2 Kitchen Etiquette
The office kitchen is a shared space. Please clean up after yourself immediately. This includes washing your dishes, wiping down counters, and not leaving food to expire in the refrigerator. The refrigerator is cleaned out every Friday evening, and any unlabeled items will be discarded.
